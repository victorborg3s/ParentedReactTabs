This project is a proof of concept using [reactjs' react-tabs](https://github.com/reactjs/react-tabs) to implement tabs that have parent related features (i.e. if some event on a TabPanel creates a new tab, the new TabPanel will be considered child of the first one; also, if a child TabPanel is closed, it shold automatically select the parent TabPanel).
